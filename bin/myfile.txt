我司承建的國際公司服務保障系統2013年工程於2015年5月8日通過了終驗並獲得了終驗證書。

本期工程緊跟國際公司網運部領導對國際服保的建設思想，初步搭建了國際服保今後的運營平臺。本期重點功能的實現，極大地提升了國際公司故障處理能力和差異化服務能力，增強了國際公司運營商及合作夥伴的管控能力。

本期工程主要對國際公司服務保障系統進行了升級改造，全面升級原客戶保障處理模式，引進國際化思想，創新開發符合國際公司管理思路的工單池處理機制；緊跟國際公司新產品開發進度，新增12個售後資料全產品對接及故障處理流程；與電子運維全面對接雙向介面功能，同時也內部門戶對接，將故障處理能力延伸至國際內部門戶端；這些都離不開所有項目成員的積極拼搏，任勞任怨；離不開集團電子運維專案組同事的大力支持與配合；離不開市場部、銷售部、研發中心、質量管理部、合肥開發中心集成部領導與同事的辛勤付出；也離不開趙總的正確指導、嚴厲要求及技術支持。今後“國際公司服務保障系統”項目組將不遺餘力做好服保系統支撐維護工作，同時也會以國際公司領導對國際服保的期望（成為世界頂級運營商服務支撐供應商）為目標，腳踏實地，做好國際服保規劃，保質保量滿足用戶需求。

“服務第一、品質為本、客戶至上”，國際服保項目組將一如既往，專注、踏實的建設好國際公司服務保障專案，為公司在國際電信的優良口碑更添光彩，為公司國際事業創造佳績、更上層樓。


We are honored to announce that on May 8th, our CTG-SAS (China Telecom Global - Service Assurance Management System) 2013 Project has passed the final test and received the certificate.

Guided by the Network Operation Department of CTG, this project has established a reliable and robust platform for the future operations of CTG-SAMS. In this project, many important and fundamental features were released. And we have helped CTG greatly improved their capabilities of fault ticket processing, differentiated services and relationship management of international operators and partners.

This project mainly focused on upgrading internal services of CTG-SAMS. Influenced by international trend, an all-new customer fault processing model, Ticket Pool, was developed to meet new CTG management and business needs. During this project, we worked closely with CTG to provide maximized support for their new products. 12 after-sale data products and their fault processing models were added. Meanwhile, the interconnections with EOMS and CTG Internal Portal were established, extending our service capabilities to other major CTG operation platforms. 

These achievements can not be made without the hard work of all team members of CTG-SAMS. And without the help from EOMS team, Marketing, Sales, R&D, QC and Integration Department, we cannot make this far. Special thanks to Mr. Zhao, our chief engineer, for his close supervision and brilliant technical guidance. In the future, CTG-SAMS team will do our best to support and maintain this system. We will make firm progress and use our quality work to meet customer needs, fighting for the goal to become the service provider of world-class operators.

Our team will stick to the “service-focused, customer-oriented and quality-based” team spirit, focuson making CTG-SAMS better for our customer, strive for greater reputation of CTG projects and make greater values for our company's international business.
